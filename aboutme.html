                            I first started in art as a kid doing traditional art and sketching both at home and at school. 
                            When I entered middle school I was encouraged by my art teachers to engage in art a lot more 
                            to learn and discover new and different mediums. I explored painting, sculpting, and crafting 
                            until I came across digital art in high school. Now I do digital art on the side while I finish 
                            college and hope to continue to grow and learn in the craft as time goes on! </mark></td>
