                            I first started in art as a kid doing traditional art and sketching both 
                            at home and at school. When I entered middle school I was encouraged by my 
                            art teachers to engage in art a lot more to learn and discover new and 
                            different mediums. I explored painting, sculpting, and crafting until I 
                            came across digital art in high school. Now I do digital art on the side 
                            while I finish college and hope to continue to grow and learn in the craft 
                            as time goes on! I hope you join me for the ride as I continue to grow and 
                            learn!</h3>
